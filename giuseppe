		<h1>"The Strange Noise in the Night"</h1>
		<hr>
		<p><i>
			It was a calm and stormy night at the Hotel Elegance, rich but slightly old-fashioned estabilishment known for its sophisticated charm.
			The fifth floor, however, had a reputation among guests for being oddly quiet, with creaky floors and faint drafts that
			could unsettle even the most brave travelers.
		</i></p>
		
		<p><i>
			At <b>midnight</b>, the tranquility of the hotel was shattered. A loud crashing noise, as if something fragile had been violently smashed,
			echoed through the corridors, follwed by a piercing, terrified scream. When hotel staff checked, they found a broken vase and an open window in Room 502.
			<br>But the room was empty!

		<h2>The Beginning and the Arrival of the Detective</h2>
		<p>
		Detective <b>Muriello Pasquale</b> had been staying at the hotel, seeking peace away from the chaotic world of crime-solving. But old habits
		die hard. The moment he heard the commotion, he stepped into the corridor, ready to take charge of the "new investigation".<br>
		He found the hotel manager, <b>Aprea Marco</b>, trembling as he led he way to room 502. The room's door was slightly open.
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li> A broken vase</li>
			<li> The window wide open, curtains swaying violenty in the cold wind</li>
			<li> The guest's belongings were still neatly arranged, but there was no sign of the guest</li>
